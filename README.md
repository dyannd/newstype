# wannaType? A minimal typing-practice web app
Implemented the simplest and easiest UI to make typing experience better for everyone. Simply type the word as underlined and press Space or Enter to get to the next one. I have also provide 3 timer options (30/60/120 seconds) to fit typers' needs. Currently, 4 themes are available, but I will soon implement a custom theme function and an account for people to save their typing logs.
